	In this written seminar work I will basically follow the section \emph{Interpolation} in the book \emph{Classical Fourier Analysis, third Edition} by Loukas Grafakos. I will review three basic but important theorems on interpolation of operators on $L^p$ spaces, namely the \emph{Marcinkiewicz Interpolation Theorem}, the \emph{Riesz-Thorin Interpolation Theorem} and finally an extension of the Riesz-Thorin Interpolation Theorem to analytic families of operators (the so-called \emph{Stein's theorem on interpolation of analytic families of operators}). We are mainly concerned with the notion of linear operators as well as slight generalizations of them.

\section{Introduction and Basic Definitions}
\subsection{Linear Operators}
First we need to have a precise and suitable idea of \emph{linear operators} in the generalized setting of measure spaces.
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{mdframed}
	\begin{definition}
		Let $(X,\mu)$ and $(Y,\nu)$ be measure spaces. Further let $T$ be an operator defined on a linear space of complex-valued measurable functions on $X$ and taking values in the set of all complex-valued, finite almost everywhere, measurable functions on $Y$. Then $T$ is called \emph{linear} if for all functions $f$ and $g$ in the domain of $T$ and all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ holds

		\begin{equation}
			T\left( f + g \right) = T(f) + T(g) \qquad T\left( zf \right) = zT(f)
			\label{eq:linear}
		\end{equation}

		and \emph{quasi-linear} if

		\begin{equation}
			\vert T\left( f + g \right) \vert \leqslant K \left( \vert T(f)\vert + \vert T(g)\vert \right) \qquad \vert T(zf) \vert = \vert z\vert \vert T(f)\vert
			\label{eq:quasilinear}
		\end{equation}

		holds for some real constant $K > 0$. If $K = 1$, $T$ is called \emph{sublinear}.
